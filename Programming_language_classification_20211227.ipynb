            "orig: I needed to replace the ceiling fan in our 12 x 14 bedroom. We purchased one from Home Depot (LED lights with remote). I thought it would be a simple \"plug and play\" using the existing box to hang the new fan. WRONG! The box that the previous owner had hung the fan from was a regular nail in place plastic box nailed to the joist with one scew stripped out and the other barely hanging on with mostly stripped threads. Why the previous fan never fell on top of us in bed remains a mystery. At least I now know why the old fan wobbled.I purchased this because I previously used one in another bedroom when I replaced a light fixture with a ceiling fan. It worked great. I have no attic and no access above the ceiling. I would have to cut through the torch down roof and the underlayment to install support for a fan.This did the trick. Even though the old box was nailed to the joist, I was able to cut the old nails off through the 4\" hole with a oscillating saw to remove the old box. The joists are on 16\" centers. I placed and tightened the remodel hanger and even though the old box was tight to the joist and the drywall was partially cut over the joist for the 4 \" hole, this hanger let me install a fan now supported on both sides. Rock solid.I don't understand previous comments about not being able to remove, slide or adjust hanger bracket. I did. If this worked in my 1950''s era home, it should work in yours.I will sleep better now know that the fan is not going to fall on me!\n",

            "orig: Thought I would spend extra money on a sprinkler for a metal one that would last longer than the plastic ones that never last a season.  My mistake.  First of all, only the frame is metal (not really sure what kind of metal it is - some type of pot metal, magnets don't stick to it), the underside, where the water is piped in, is all plastic. There is a metal coupling that your hose threads into has a thin plastic/rubber ring around it that is supposed to make tightening the coupling to the hose easier.  Except it doesn't.  The plastic ring is just loose around the coupling and within the first day of use immediately was abraded enough on the inner part to make it unusable.  In fact, it made it *more* difficult to tighten or loosen since it just spins around the metal coupling.  Pull that off thinking you can tighten by hand is a mistake also as the outer part of the coupling is closer to jagged serrations than actual an nut head.  Wait! If that is not enough, the coupling does not fit tightly against the inner part of the tubing that goes to the sprinkler, so of course it leaks like a sieve!  Yes I have replaced the inner washers with brand new ones and it made no difference.  Save your money and look elsewhere.  It is simply amazing what companies sell anymore.  The days of quality and value are long gone.\n",

Maybe 6 times out of 30 clamps.   The instructions say to NOT ratchet more than 7 times BUT it takes 3 or 4 ratchets just to reach the clamp.. so do you count from 3 for 7 for 10 in total or from 4 for 7 for a total of 11.. or do you just keep squeezing until the light comes on BUT that only happens sometimes.  AND if you weren't sure if you are on 10 or 11 and try one more squeeze the tool doesn't release when you twist the release knob.  I did a medium sized project with just under 30 clamps and 3 out of the 30 left the tool hanging on the pipe.  Would try squeezing even harder while trying to turn the release knob, smacking it with a screw driver and at one point thought about how to disassemble the tool while it was stuck hanging from the pipe.

The 6\" long aluminum stake will provide good stabilization when inserted fully in the ground. A flow thru hose connection allows \"daisy-chaining\" of several units together. In the Texas heat, the plastic cap might end up cracking, so I would suggest replacing it with a metal cap if you are not daisy-chaining other units. As with all sprinklers, the settings for distance will be determined by the amount of water pressure at your home. Lower water pressure equals less distance.

I was able to use this device without making my 4\" hole any larger.. It was perfect. There are two nuts inside that holds a bracket in place that connects the bar to the electrical housing. REMOVE these in order to detach the bar. Once the bar is detached you can install it first. Make sure the bar is level when tightening. Once the bar is tight, you can then clamp the bracket back around the bar and attach the electrical housing.

            "orig: I've owned 4 of these toilets to date. The first two worked flawlessly with a super easy install and great rebate offered by local water company. The last two have been nothing but trouble. The tank itself bubbles (NOT the bowl), right by the black enclosure which surrounds the flush valve. After calling Niagara and speaking with 4 different humans and 1 human manager, multiple times, I have been told to continue waiting while an engineer \"researches\" the problem/solution. I have been awaiting a call back with their findings for over 2 weeks, even after I asked for updates along the way. Unfortunately, a bubbling sound is very bothersome and annoying and apparently it's par for the course according to the human manager over at Niagara. He assured me it is just part of the package deal, which is weird because neither of my two previous Niagara toilets had this issue nor could I find another issue mentioned online anywhere. To this date, Niagara has all but given up on providing mediocre customer service to the customers with any sort of real issue. Their default response is to offer a replacement part before they even understand the symptoms. The greatest part about good ole Troy's response over there at Niagara is that the engineer doesn't need to know what I've tried or adjusted or controlled for in all my tinkering with the toilet over the last month.

            "orig: I already own the Ring Doorbell Pro but the way my garage is recessed on the driveway, the doorbell cam cannot see where I park my car at night. We have had recent occurrences of people checking car doors at night so this camera made sense for safety and security and the light (and sensor) is a good deterrent when it turns on.I mounted this cam above the garage door at an angle that has a full view of my car and all the way across the street. The wide angle lens is excellent and shows a lot of real estate. I chose the wired version since I have an outlet within the distance of the provided power wire (very long) and simply drilled a hole at the spot and ran the cord through the wall (See pictures). The kit comes with wire clamps that can be nailed in every 3 feet or so and it makes it look like a professional install. I then plugged it into the outlet on the ceiling where the garage door opener plugs in.It has a lot of features but here are my favorites.- No direct wiring. Simply plug it in a configure. (They sell direct wire and even battery versions as well)- The spotlight sensitivity and area detection are both adjustable so I can set it to only turn on the light when you are half way up the driveway. However, it will start recording when a person is walking on the sidewalk on my side of the street or even across the street.- I set it so it will only record when a person is detected. It will not record when a car drives by. It can be set either this was just a personal preference.- The light intensity is adjustable as well. I have it set to Max and it is blinding.- The night vision is excellent.- Two really cool features: - I can click a button in the smartphone app and speak to my phone and the audio comes out of the camera speaker allowing you to talk to some on the driveway. The microphone on the camera allows the person to talk back. During a recording session the camera records audio. Crystal clear audio even 60 or more feet away. Some neighborhood kids were arguing about cleaning up dog poop on my lawn the other day and I could hear every word and that was 60 feet away. (They cleaned it up) - There is also a button on the app to turn on an audible alarm. The motion sensor will flash red when you do this.- The install is extremely easy and even with drilling that hole took a total of 15 minutes.A lot more can be configured but these are the main items that I use.The reason I gave it four instead of five stars is the zoom functionality. When you zoom in it gets more and more pixelated as you get closer. I do have friends that have other brands and admittedly they do the same thing. Hopefully this gets better in the future.All in all I really like the security they provide. I can wake up in the morning and see all the activity that occurred at night to ensure that nobody was near my house, or I can be alerted in real time during the night if there is activity.5 Stars for ease of install5 Stars for quality and features4 Stars for Zoom in picture quality\n",

The outlet is usually used under a lectern, and a narrow dc power supply fits nicely for a light (though the cover won't close with it plugged in). The closing cover does work well and stays shut when standard cords are used. The main reason we went with this model was its use of a decora style outlet. As I mentioned, we were replacing an older outlet that was a standard outlet within 2 feet of a baptistry pool. It was very easy to change out the outlet that this cover came with to a GFCI outlet to make it safer for floor use.The only downside I had was because both the outlet box and the cover need to fit into the hole, there is almost no play on the measurements if you are off. The screws that hold the box to the floor come very close to the edge of the hole so it is important to cut the hole exactly as specified.\n",

I have already dropped it on the concrete, and not a scratch on it, after it bounced around. The parts that connect to the hoses are metal, which makes them even more durable. The sprayer design allows you to decide what type of spray to use, by just squeezing the lever differently, from a very light fan type of spray for watering delicate flowers, to a powerful spray, that shoots about 25 feet, for things like washing your car. The grip has a notch for your index finger, which helps it stay in your hand, even when wet. There is also a metal flip piece, that allows you to set the spray level, and not have to continuously squeeze the handle to keep it spraying. The other cool design thing, is the screw piece on the end of the nozzle, so you can attach another hose to it, or attach those weed and feed spray attachments to it, to give more power and control over the water flow, when using those types of things. If you are looking for a basic sprayer, but want a few extra bells and whistles, I highly recommend the Expert Gardener Industrial Nozzle.See more\n",

This nozzle is a smaller sized nozzle than I had expected and it seems to be a lighter weight metal, which I'm afraid won't last past one summer. This nozzle would be appropriate for gardening and yard use for sure. The water stream can be adjusted by using the gold colored screw on the back side of the nozzle. Even though you can adjust it, it's really not really accurate on the adjusting part. You can shoot a full powered stream of water or make it a spread out shower pattern but that's about it. This nozzle is good when you clean out horse trailers or when you wash pickups and it works good to spray the under side of a muddy pickup too. These are handy tools to have around the yard during the summer for sure.See more\n",

But as I used it on the garden hose, it is not any different than the other hose nozzles of various styles.  The pulsating stream is just a faster version of sliding your thumb left and right over the hose end. The impact I noticed was that the sound of the water being sent side to side by the little thing in the nozzle made the sound of the impact hammer or drill. But thats it.

            "orig: The Expert Gardener brand telescoping wand is the perfect accessory to have if you wash your vehicle yourself instead of going to a car wash, which is the primary reason I got it. The main advantages to using this wand when washing a car is the ability to control the water flow to a very very low rate, along with an adjustable water pattern spray. When rinsing the car with the very low water flow spray, with the pattern set to a wide setting, it really helps to prevent water spots on the car as compared to using a regular water hose with sprayer attachment. The telescoping action of the wand also allows you to direct the rinse water where you want it to go on top of the car without straining to reach those areas.In my experience, and this is with the hard water in Phoenix AZ, the water spots are almost eliminated on the vertical areas (the sides, the doors, etc) of the car after rinsing. Horizontal areas such as the hood and the top still need some towel drying though (I think you would need a mineral free water to help with that).The adjustable water flow is easily controlled with your thumb on the handle area of the wand. From zero flow to full pressure flow. Its a lever that is moved instead of a squeeze type control, so you can set it and not have to constantly hold it to maintain a desired pressure/flow. The wand length extends from about 27 inches, to a fully extended length of 42 inches. And the spray head at the end pivots, so you can have a rain like spray over an area from a distance.There are 10 spray patterns that can be selected, by turning the dial that is around the spray head. FLAT (which is my preference for low flow final rinse when washing my car), CENTER, JET, MIST, FAN, ANGLE, SHOWER, VERTICAL, FULL, and CONE.See more\n",

            "orig: This is probably as good a plier type pex cutting tool as you going to findâ€”very sturdy (all metal) and well made. That said, it suffers from the same deficiency that all of these tool designs doâ€”it takes some degree of skill to achieve a perfect right angle cut when it should not have to. Firstly, when you lay the pex run atop the cradle or bottom jaw of the tool, you are placing it on a smooth open sweeping surface that really offers no buttressing or guide positioning. So you must hold the length of pex perfectly still at a precise right angle against the cradle surface. Secondly, as you squeeze the handles and the blade begins to bite down on top of the tubing, the tool begins to try to pull the pex at an oblique angle, potentially jeopardizing the integrity of the cut. After a few practice tries, I was able to achieve a fairly decent square cutâ€”not perfect, but close. This tool could greatly be improved with the addition of some type of half pipe channel guideâ€”perhaps an inch or so long that was the same as the O.D. of the pex and attached to either side of the bottom jaw at right angles. That way, you could feed the tubing into the channel where it would be held in place. When you then squeezed the jaws, the tubing would be held fast, and would have no ability to wiggle or shift position, thereby yielding a perfect and precise right angle cut every time with no possibility of error. This, in my opinion would be a tremendous improvement to this type of tool with minimal redesigning. Are you listening Milwaukee?\n",

However, there are still small gnats or some kind of bug that makes it inside. I had the spline from my other screen that was on already. So, I did order new, but when I took it out it was toi old to reuse, so I recommend just buying new spline. Otherwise,you may just end up running up to the local hardware store while in the middle of the project & hoping they have the size & color in stock. Screen seems solid and looks like it'll hold up. Shipping was quick and I would definitely buy from this seller again. Just make sure to measure 2x.

He likes being able to stand on the porch and have a nozzle that will spray across the front yard.
